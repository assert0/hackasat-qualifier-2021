Inputs to controller

    velocity
    acceleration

    radar_acquired
        altitude - this value is unreliable if radar_acquired isn't active

    leg1_touchdown
    leg2_touchdown
    leg3_touchdown

    landing_enable - leg sensors ignored until this is active.  Enabled after radar turned off
    
Outputs

    parachute_deploy
    backshell_eject
    deploy_legs
    thrust%
    engine_cutoff
    constant_velocity_phase


Spacecraft_state

    parachute_deployed - this is a starting condition?
    backshell_ejected (parachute attached) - this has to happen by a certain time of its a failure
        coefficient of friction changes
    legs_deployed - this should take a few seconds once commanded
    powered_descent started
    constant velocity phase 
    

Needed features
    detect if the engine has not been shutoff within 40 ms of touchdown.  Set error if not.
