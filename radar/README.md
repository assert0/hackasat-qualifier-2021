# Quals Challenge: Radar #

**Category:** Guardians of the...
**Relative Difficulty:** 4/5
**Author:** [Cromulence](https://cromulence.com/)

```
Given the radar pulse returns of a satellite, determine its orbital parameters (assume two-body dynamics).
Each pulse has been provided as:
   t,  timestamp (UTC)
   az, azimuth (degrees) +/- 0.001 deg
   el, elevation (degrees) +/- 0.001 deg
   r,  range (km) +/- 0.1 km

The radar is located at Kwajalein, 8.7256 deg latitude, 167.715 deg longitude, 35m altitude.

Estimate the satellite's orbit by providing the following parameters:
   a,  semi-major axis (km)
   e,  eccentricity (dimensionless)
   i,  inclination (degrees)
   Ω,  RAAN (degrees)
   ω,  argument of perigee (degrees)
   υ,  true anomaly (degrees)
at the time of the final radar pulse, 2021-06-27-00:09:52.000-UTC
